# This file contains various command lines that are useful for
# demonstrating and working with the example.

# Run strace with some useful arguments:
#   -y -yy: Print filename in addition to file descriptor number
#   -tt: Print timestamp of each system call
#   -T: Print duration of each system call
#   -e trace=file: Print only file-related system calls
#   -r: relative timestamps
strace -e trace=file -y -yy -r -t -T ./ex_trace

# Also print a backtrace for each system call (only supported if strace
# was compiled with libunwind support)
strace -k -e trace=file -y -yy -r -t -T ./ex_trace |& c++filt
