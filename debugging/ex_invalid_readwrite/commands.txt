# This file contains various command lines that are useful for
# demonstrating and working with the example.

# Run the example through valgrind (do not build with enabled sanitizers in this case)
valgrind --leak-check=no --track-origins=yes ./ex_invalid_readwrite

# Compile example with the address sanitizer enabled.
# Use clang since it usually has better sanitizers than GCC.
qmake CONFIG+="sanitizer sanitize_address" -spec linux-clang-libc++; make clean; make

# Like the above, but also enable continuing after encountering an error
qmake QMAKE_CXXFLAGS+="-fsanitize-recover=all" CONFIG+="sanitizer sanitize_address" -spec linux-clang-libc++; make clean; make

# Run the example
ASAN_SYMBOLIZER_PATH=/usr/lib/llvm-4.0/bin/llvm-symbolizer ./ex_invalid_readwrite

# Run the example and continue on error (needs -fsanitize-recover=all from above)
ASAN_SYMBOLIZER_PATH=/usr/lib/llvm-4.0/bin/llvm-symbolizer ASAN_OPTIONS=halt_on_error=0 ./ex_invalid_readwrite
